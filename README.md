Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:
. (period) which can match any single character
* (asterisk) which can match zero or more occurrences of character before *
That is, implement a programme that takes as input a string and a valid regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches the given regular expression.
For example: if the given regular expression is “.ay” and given string is “ray”, then the function must return true and if the regular expression is “abc*cda” and string is “abccd”, then the function must return false
